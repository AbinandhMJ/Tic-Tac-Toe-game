## Description
**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a classic two-player strategy game played on a **3x3** grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of your chosen symbol (usually **"X"** or **"O"**) on the grid. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell, and the game ends when one player wins or the grid is filled, resulting in a draw. It's a simple yet engaging game that's often used for entertainment and as a learning tool for basic strategy and tactics.
